Good start here - and your getMax and getMin methods work great.

The Index methods, on the other hand, are supposed to return the **location** of the max or min;
  instead, they return the max or min itself.
You will want to make these integer methods, where position holds the index of the max or min item.
That probably means you need a new variable, so you can keep track of both 
  the largest (smallest) item (a String) and where it is (an integer).

8/10 now; 9/10 when updates are completed.
